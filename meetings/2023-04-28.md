# 2023-04-28 Package Modules Working Group Meeting

- [Working Group Info](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/working-group-member-search-module-system-for-packages/26574)
- [Repository](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules)
- Attendees: @infinisil @edolstra @snowytrees @phaer @DavHau @growpotkin

## Agenda and Notes

- Introduction and availability
- How to work together
  - Meetings: Administration and synchronous discussions
  - Matrix room: Asynchronous discussions
  - Repository: Asynchronous tasks
- Milestone planning, @infinisil's proposal:
  - 1. [ ] Document and understand the problems and use cases
  - 2. [ ] Document and understand potential solution mechanisms
  - 3. [ ] Evaluate and compare each mechanism and their feasibility
  - 4. [ ] Develop proof-of-concept's for viable mechanisms
  - 5. [ ] ...
  - We reached agreement on this initial plan
- Decide and delegate tasks

## Notes

- @infinisil: @phaer do you also want to be in the working group?
  - @phaer: Will think about it for the next meeting
  - @DavHau: Close in contact

## Use case document

- General information
- Concrete examples
- Current problems

## Use cases
- @growpotkin: Deeply replacing packages in Nixpkgs, e.g. security patching
- @DavHau: Customizing a package definition
  - More internal: Being able to inject additional build commands at arbitrary points into package builders
- @niksnut: Being able to see the available customization options
- @snowytrees: Good error messages for mistaken definitions
- @infinisil: Unified API for building packages and NixOS configuration
  - Usage of the module system for different use-cases
    - e.g. NixOS + HomeManager
    - already often confusing to new users
    -> think about how to keep differences & similarities clear,
       when introducing a module system for pkgs
- @DavHau: Be able to depend on features of other packages (feature resolution)
- @snowytrees: Knowing the defaults of options
  - Accessing previous levels of configuration
- Fast rebuilds when only part of the derivation changes
- Creating packages, maintainers
  - Being able to start by copying other package definitions
  - Using Nixpkgs build support functions (and documentation of them)
  - Creating language/framework integrations (e.g. Rust, Haskell, etc.)
  - Plugin/setup hook integration
- Changing the interface of a package separately from the implementation, e.g. for changing only the interface or only the implementation

### Action items
- @everybody: Document above use cases, put results as a PR/commit to https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules/tree/main/use-cases
- @infinisil: Put the milestones into the readme
- @infinisil: Commit the meeting notes
