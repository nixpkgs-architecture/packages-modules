# Package Modules Working Group

This working group is there to investigate the possibility of using something like the [module system](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-writing-modules) for Nixpkgs packages.

All working group members will have access to this repository. The end goal is to have an RFC developed that can be proposed. Using issues and pull requests to achieve that is encouraged.
