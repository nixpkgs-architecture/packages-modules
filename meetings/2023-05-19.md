### Having everybody review PRs, automation?
- @infinisil: Let's set up some basic automation to automatically request reviews from everybody
- Maybe pings? But shouldn't be too spammy

### Does @snowytrees still have time?
- @infinisil: Remove from team for now, can be onboarded again

### Use case vs problem vs goal
- Commented here with the idea: https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules/pull/16#issuecomment-1554458427
