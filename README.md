# [Package Modules Working Group][wg-github]

This working group is there to investigate the possibility of using something
like the [NixOS module system][module-system] for Nixpkgs packages. See the
[discourse post][discourse-thread] for more info.

All working group members have access to [this repository][wg-github]. The
end goal is to have an [RFC](./rfc.md) developed that can be proposed. Using
[issues][wg-issues] and [pull requests][wg-pulls] to achieve that is encouraged.

## Meetings

We meet **weekly, every Friday at 13:00 UTC** in [this Jitsi][wg-jitsi].

Notes are written live in [this pad][wg-pad] during meetings, and collected
below afterwards. Presentations are streamed via YouTube, with recordings available on
[Youtube: @nixpkgs-architecture][yt-nixpkgs-architecture].
