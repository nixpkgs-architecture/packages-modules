Attendees: @infinisil @edolstra @tomberek @DavHau @Gytis

- Merged two PRs
- Try to get most people into a meeting for https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules/issues/20
  - @DavHau: Anything specific I should talk about
    - @infinisil: `pkgs.linuxPackages.overrideScope' (self: super: { ... })`
    - @Gytis: Performance of evaluation?
- Created https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules/issues/22
- Nickel presentation at some point? Would be fair, even if it doesn't seem realistic
