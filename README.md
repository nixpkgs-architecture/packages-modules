# [Package Modules Working Group][wg-github]

This working group is there to investigate the possibility of using something
like the [NixOS module system][module-system] for Nixpkgs packages. See the
[discourse post][discourse-thread] for more info.

All working group members have access to [this repository][wg-github]. The
end goal is to have an [RFC](./rfc.md) developed that can be proposed. Using
[issues][wg-issues] and [pull requests][wg-pulls] to achieve that is encouraged.

## Meetings

We meet **weekly, every Friday at 13:00 UTC** in [this Jitsi][wg-jitsi].

Notes are written live in [this pad][wg-pad] during meetings, and committed to the [./meetings](./meetings) folder afterwards.
Occasional presentations are streamed and recorded to [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHG2N-mfvWT48ZGoUC5W6OMMdln0IsNrq) on the Nixpkgs Architecture Team channel.

## Milestones

- 1. [ ] Document and understand the [problems](./problems/) and use cases
- 2. [ ] Document and understand potential solution mechanisms
- 3. [ ] Evaluate and compare each mechanism and their feasibility
- 4. [ ] Develop proof-of-concept's for viable mechanisms
- 5. [ ] ...
- We reached agreement on this initial plan
